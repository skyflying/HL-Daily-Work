# HL-Daily-Work

This project is one of my Offshorewind project during the construction stage. The installation would be the daily task.
Therefore, I created the python script for generateing the spatial file from the csv file and the vector spatial data(shapefile, geojson, geopackage).

The script includes the installation tasks below.
- Pinpile
- Jacket
- Dredging
- Trenching
